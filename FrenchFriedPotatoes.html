    <p>
        These are <em> the best French Fries </em>
        - the sugar solution has something to do with the carbohydrates, but by doing it they 
        don't soak up so much grease, so they get crunchy.

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
        We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking <br>
        The exact amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density,
        and the specific type of oil used.
